Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built using **React**, **Vite**, **TailwindCSS**, and **DaisyUI**. This site mainly showcases my coding skills and projects, but also serves as a way to get to know me better and contact me.

## Note

This website was entirely built for the 1920x1080 resolution, so it is not responsive, ***yet***.
